Hence, in light of the foregoing, when you agree to purchase the car tickets listed on the Website by the car operator, that would be termed as a 'valid offer' under the applicable law Subsequently, when the same is being confirmed by the car operator it tantamount to be a 'valid contract' as per the applicable law.</p>
